                          I think the best thing about being in Formula Student Racing is how it prepares you for real life experiences. I know how lame it sounds and you hear stuff like that from alot of people, but it's true. It teaches you how extensive the design process actually is, not to mention what it takes to fabricate one of those things! It teaches you things that you don't learn in classes - how to network and raise funds, how to cost out a prototype, how to machine or layup composite parts, and the list goes on... And, it's the only real way to get a job in the automotive or racing industry because being in this program
                          literally puts you miles ahead of the competition.
                          We are Nequit family and we are with you to help in technology transformation,
                          planning and management guidance and whatever team needs.
                          One thing I forgot to mention. Even if you pass out, if you are passionate enough you won't be able to leave Race Car. I was called to be the Judge at Formula Bharat and SUPRA. Yeah tha's how the legacy
                          continues.
                          All the best for success...
                          We are not designed to come second or third, we are designed to
                          win....Never Quit.....BecauseRacCar...!

                      <p>My journey can be best described in the above lines. I still remember myself meeting our captain Mr. Akshay Chavan for the first time in the 'Bapu Chowk' of Main building. The kind of impression that he laid on me was so immense that I decided that very moment that I want to
      be a part of this team.I tried to do as much possible within the limited amount of money that we had with a VISION
      decided. Vision is must. To rectify, I would say an action is must with a vision.
      First Priority Team, Second priority Team, Third priority team and so on...If you work like thisyour name will be tagged with your team, your name will not require any other identity...Yes....I am not saying this out of SELF PRIDE...Never...I am saying this as I have witnessed this thing.
         I guess I can write innumerable pages about my team. Honestly. I know I am just a commoner.
      Yeah, I know I am just a simple man, but, if you current team members know my name then all what it says is DECIDE, DEDICATE and ACT. Yes, I am who I am just because of Team Nequit. I am damn proud of this. I guess life is shit if
      you don't have anything to say that I made this.
      Team. Yes, TEAM is the Best Teacher I ever had.</p>

                            <p>I joined the team in my second year and was a member until I passed out. After joining Team Nequit I started working in Engine department. I used to read different design reports in order to understand various design aspects. I was very curious to understand different systems and there design procedures. Our Captain Pranav used to send me to different places to meet business people and convince them to give sponsorship. I used to accompany Ravi in this adventure. At that time I was very shy person and did not know how to communicate, on the other hand Ravi was excellent in convincing people. He used to do all the talking and I used to just observe him. Sometimes we returned empty handed and sometimes we were successful. Slowly I started coming out of my comfort zone and started supporting Ravi. These were my first lessons on effective communication which I learned from my teammate. Being part of the team gives you this opportunity to learn from observing your teammates. Team forces you to collaborate with others and observe their best qualities. I was very lucky to be surrounded by excellent teammates who taught me many skills which are part of my life.
            When I started working as Engine and Powertrain head we used to face many problems in our system. To get to know these problems and to resolve them was very challenging job. It helped me to develop very important problem solving skills. We learned how to look at a problem from all the perspective in order to reach to the root of that problem. Till date I use this technique to resolve the issues in front of me. I got an opportunity to improve my leadership skills when I became the Captain of team. We had a challenge to participate and perform for the first time at Formula Bharat. Because of the hard work from team members, we performed excellent in that event. I was fortunate to be the driver of the team also; along with my co-driver Onkar we completed the endurance race of 21 kms. We also faced many tense situations during the event from which I learned how to remain calm in tensed conditions. It was a memorable event.
            Being part of the team is a big learning opportunity. You get to learn many skills which otherwise you will never learn just being a student. From each team member you can learn something; from each situation you can learn something. In your life you will face many difficult challenges, performing well in team will give you the confidence to take on those challenges. Do your best and Never Quit.</p>

                          1) As the name suggests, here I firstly learned to never give up at any given
          situation, until and unless I achieve the final committed objective.
          2) This results into an attitude “FAILING AND LEARNING TO MAKE SUCCESS
          OUT OF IT BY NEVER QUITTING "

          Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision, the ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel    that allows  common  people  to attain uncommon results.

          The most amazing feeling is experiencing the journey of building a car right from scratch on paper to outperforming a car
          on the F1 track

                            <p>I joined the team in my third year of engineering, but desire to join the team was from second year as
            I saw captain Pranav driving gravity 2.0 in college campus. That moment I decided to join the team.
            I started my FS journey with “Team Nequit” for new season of Formula Bharat in suspension
            department with enormous amount of passion. It was challenging task for suspension team to build a
            system with “zero compliance”. Here I understood the hard work required for a single task to be done,
            which in turns adds to team’s goals. I still remember those sleepless nights of diwali vacation, where
            we were working to get things done for photographic submission.
            At the FB2018 event (my first event), I felt amazing as well as worrying at the same time by looking
            at other teams and cars. The environment of event was very enthusiastic and everyone out there was
            full of passion towards formula student. We cleared all necessary tests and completed endurance and
            won Rookie team of the year award. Every member felt that energy of cheering “Nequit-Nequit”
            while receiving the award.
            In SUPRA’18 season, we performed very well in all aspects. That was because of captain Shubham
            Yadav. He planned and executed things very well. He taught me discipline, team management skills,
            decision making, task and time managing skills and many more. He brought confidence in me.
            For the next Formula Bharat season, I was assigned the role of Captain by Shubham Yadav. I was
            surprised at first moment but took this as great opportunity and responsibility. This was the turning
            point of my engineering and professional career. It was very challenging for me and team as well to
            design, build and test the vehicle in six months. The team was structured well and highly motivated.
            The journey started well and some tasks completed as planned, some with tolerance in deadline. We
            met all document submission deadlines and in only 5 months the car was on four wheels!!! Amazing!
            I think no one form that team will forget the period of 5 months. But unfortunately, we ran into big
            engine problem and that costs us dynamic events at the competition. I thank all the members of that
            team who supported and backed up team in those situations.
            After this failure, it was difficult to maintain team’s bonding. Captain Rupesh managed well and team
            was up for the next event SUPRA’19. This time team was very young and less experienced. So, I
            decided to be with team in this time. This was my last event and also last chance to fulfill the dream
            of completing all dynamic events and endurance at BIC, Delhi. The event dates were extended and
            they overlapped with joining dates of company in which I was placed. I remember those inspirational
            words form Shubham Yadav - “Go for the event, don’t think about job, you will get better in coming
            time”. He was right and I went. We cleared TI, tilt, noise in first day of the event and brakes test in
            following day. I was the driver for Skidpad and Auto-X. I felt that pressure as every team’s driver
            feels. The skidpad went very well but Auto-x was not upto the expectations. The next day was
            endurance day. With excitement and fear in mind, I and Co-driver Sourabh Pawar went on track.
            There was only one thing in mind, ‘At any cost, I have to complete the race’. And we did it. Team
            Nequit completed endurance at BIC for the very first time with 6th rank in race. The unforgettable
            day in my life.
            I heard many times, ‘never give up, never quit’. But, in real life I went through it. There are many
            things I learned, core technical skills and soft skills in FS journey with Team Nequit. But, this is
            something different, I learned and experienced that - as the name suggests, “Never ever quit!!!
            NEQUIT”.
            I continued my FS passion and won’t be able to leave race car thing. I am Junior Tech Inspector at
            Formula Bharat and now also as Document reviewer.
            At the end, All the best for the current team members, believe in yourself and team. Always keep in
            mind, “If you can’t stop thinking about it, don’t stop working for it”</p>

                NEQUIT -  the team that taught me to never quit in anything you chose. This team  created  interest in me in manufacturing  and  automobile. And also the main thing is management, decision making, problem solving.
            This team is the platform for all of us to apply all the learned concepts and seeing those concepts working in front of your eyes is the most satisfying thing I have.
                           With a millions of memories, learnings, alumni and guide feedback, national exposure at events taught many life lessons.
                    It created the confidence and courage in me to fight against any problem in life. We can't forget those memories throughout life.
            And the most important thing is working in a team I learnt. And the happiness and bonding with all the memories is just unexplainable. I am still living those days...... In heart.
                  Day and night manufacturing, extraordinary inventions, failed trials, cracking jokes, going for food, playing cricket, designing, testing days in winter......
             Everything I miss. And whatever I am today and I will be tomorrow is because of my team and team members......</p>

                <p>Attending SUPRA event for very first time was exciting, I saw the time to many
teams came up with excellent work and tremendous energy. Team Nequit2.0
was also full of enthusiasm and working hard for the second event. I was a new
face to prepare and present a Cost report at a static event. This was a new task
to me here I learnt about excel sheets, reports, presentations, and the very
important thing is getting things ready before time. There are strict deadlines
for submitting reports and hardly we could manage to submit it. In the next
session I joined Chassis design and CAE part in continuation with Cost report.
This time I knew each component from all systems. Burning midnight oil gave
us an award for best “Cost Report at event SUPRA 2016”. It was the best
feeling for such an achievement in the team.
Real-time examples of your design and integration of multiple concepts. looks
like another world in college and I could saw more than the classroom and I
feel it's interesting. This Learnings helped me to achieve the “Best Intern
Award” in TATA MOTORS, Pune, and still supporting me in my Master
Studies.</p>
